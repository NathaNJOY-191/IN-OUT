# In-out

This repo contains a Vite + React frontend and a minimal Express + MongoDB backend (in /server) for auth and bookings for IN&OUT.

Quickstart

1. Start the server:

```
cd server; npm install; npm run seed; npm start
```

2. In the frontend root, set VITE_API_URL in `.env` if the server isn't at http://localhost:4000.

3. Run the frontend:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
